<h2>Tutorial Overview</h2>

<p>This tutorial will cover the basics of RNA-seq using Galaxy; a open-source web-based platform for the analysis of biological data. You should gain an appreciation of the tasks involved in a typical RNA-seq analysis and be comfortable with the outputs generated by the Bioinformatician.</p>

<h3>More on Galaxy</h3>

<p>The official Galaxy page has many <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/learn/">tutorials</a> on using the service, and examples of other types of analysis that can be performed on the platform.</p>

<p>Those eventually wanted to perform their own RNA-seq analysis (for example in R), should look out for other courses</p>

<h2>Background [15 min]</h2>

<h4>Where does the data in this tutorial come from?</h4>

<p>The data for this tutorial is from the paper, <em>A comprehensive comparison of
RNA-Seq-based transcriptome analysis from reads to differential gene expression
and cross-comparison with microarrays: a case study in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae</em> by Nookaew et al. [1] which studies S.cerevisiae strain CEN.PK
113-7D (yeast) under two different metabolic conditions: glucose-excess (batch)
or glucose-limited (chemostat).</p>

<p>The RNA-Seq data has been uploaded in NCBI, short read archive (SRA), with
accession SRS307298. There are 6 samples in total-- two treatments with
three biological replicates each sequenced paired-end.  We have selected only
the first read, and only two replicates of each condition to keep the data small
for this workshop.</p>

<p>We have extracted chromosome I reads from the samples to make the
tutorial a suitable length. </p>

<h3>Reminder about Experimental Design</h3>

<p>Modern sequencing technologies are extremely sophisticated and give an accurate picture of an individuals genome or transcriptome. However, if the experiment has not been design appropriately to address the biological question of interest, then the data generated may be useless. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To consult the statistician after an experiment is finished is often merely to ask him to conduct a post mortem examination. He can perhaps say what the experiment died of. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Preferably speak to a statistician in advance of performing your experiments</p>

<p><img src="https://ycl6.gitbooks.io/rna-seq-data-analysis/Workflow.png" alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>For this tutorial, we will assume that the <em>wet-lab</em> stages of the experiment have been performed and we are now in the right-hand branch of the workflow. We will demonstrate the steps of <strong>Quality assessment</strong>, <strong>alignment</strong>, <strong>quantification</strong> and <strong>differential expression testing</strong>.</p>

<h2>Section 1: Preparation [15 min]</h2>

<h4>1.  Register as a new user on our Monash Galaxy server</h4>

<ol>
<li><p>Open a browser and go to a Galaxy server : <a href="http://galaxy.erc.monash.edu/galaxy/">galaxy.erc.monash.edu/galaxy</a></p></li>
<li><p>Register as a new user by clicking <strong>User > Register</strong> on the top
dark-grey bar. Alternatively, if you already have an account, login by
clicking <strong>User > Login</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Other Galaxy servers</h3>

<p><strong>If the Monash server is down, you may need to find an alternative</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>https://galaxy.hidelab.org/</li>
<li>http://services.cbib.u-bordeaux.fr/galaxy/</li>
<li>http://usegalaxy.org </li>
</ul>

<h4>2.  Import the RNA-seq data for the workshop.</h4>

<p>We can going to import the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format"><em>fastq</em> files</a> for this experiment. This is a standard format for storing raw sequencing reads and their associated quality scores. Each read is described by 4 lines in the file:-</p>

<p><img src="media/fastq-header.png"></p>

<p>The quality scores are <a href="http://ascii-code.com/">ASCII</a> representations of how confident we are that a particular base has been called correctly. Letters that are further along the alphabet indicate higher confidence. This is important when trying to identify types of genome variation such as single base changes, but is also indicative of the overall quality of the sequencing. Different scales are possible (resulting in a different set of characters appearing in the file). We will need to tell Galaxy which scale has been used in order that we can process the data correctly.</p>

<p><img src="media/phred.png"></p>

<p>You can import the data by:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the tool panel located on the left, under Basic Tools select <strong>Get
Data > Upload File</strong>. Click on the <strong>Paste/Fetch data</strong> button on the
bottom section of the pop-up window.</li>
<li><p>Upload the sequence data by pasting the following links into the text
input area.
These two files are single-end samples from the batch condition
(glucose-excess). Make sure the type is specified as 'fastqsanger'
when uploading.</p>

<div class="code">
https://swift.rc.nectar.org.au:8888/v1/AUTH_a3929895f9e94089ad042c9900e1ee82/RNAseqDGE_ADVNCD/batch1_chrI_1.fastq
<br>
https://swift.rc.nectar.org.au:8888/v1/AUTH_a3929895f9e94089ad042c9900e1ee82/RNAseqDGE_ADVNCD/batch2_chrI_1.fastq
<br>
</div>

<p>These two files are single-end samples from the chem condition
(glucose-limited). Make sure the type is specified as 'fastqsanger'
when uploading.</p>

<div class="code">
https://swift.rc.nectar.org.au:8888/v1/AUTH_a3929895f9e94089ad042c9900e1ee82/RNAseqDGE_ADVNCD/chem1_chrI_1.fastq
<br>
https://swift.rc.nectar.org.au:8888/v1/AUTH_a3929895f9e94089ad042c9900e1ee82/RNAseqDGE_ADVNCD/chem2_chrI_1.fastq
<br>
</div>

<p>Then, upload this file of gene definitions. You do not need to specify
the type for this file as Galaxy will auto-detect the file as a GTF
file.</p>

<div class="code">
https://swift.rc.nectar.org.au:8888/v1/AUTH_a3929895f9e94089ad042c9900e1ee82/RNAseqDGE_ADVNCD/genes.gtf
</div></li>
<li><p>You should now have these 5 files in your history:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>batch1_chrI_1.fastq</code></li>
<li><code>batch2_chrI_1.fastq</code></li>
<li><code>chem1_chrI_1.fastq</code></li>
<li><code>chem2_chrI_1.fastq</code></li>
<li><code>genes.gtf</code></li>
</ul>

<p>These files can be renamed by clicking the <strong>pen icon</strong> if you wish.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Low quality reads have already been trimmed.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2>Section 2: Quality assessment with FastQC</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">FastQC</a> is a popular tool from <a href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/index.html">Babraham Institute Bioinformatics Group</a> used for <em>quality assessment</em> of sequencing data. Most Bioinformatics pipelines will use FastQC, or similar tools in the first stage of the analysis. The <a href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/">documentation</a> for FastQC will help you to interpret the plots and stats produced by the tool. A traffic light system is used to alert the user's attention to possible issues. However, it is worth bearing in mind that the tool is blind to the particular type of sequencing you are performing (i.e. whole-genome, ChIP-seq, RNA-seq), so some warnings might be expected due to the nature of your experiment.</p>

<ul>
<li>From the left hand tool panel in Galaxy, under <em>NGS ANALYSIS</em>, select <em>NGS: QC and manipulation -> FastQC</em></li>
<li>Select one of the FASTQ files as input and <em>Execute</em> the tool.</li>
<li>When the tool finishes running, you should have an HTML file in your History. Click on the eye icon to view the various quality metrics.</li>
</ul>

<p>Look at the generated FastQC metrics. This data looks pretty good - high per-base quality scores (most above 30).</p>

<p><img src="media/fastqc.png" height=700px></p>

<h2>Section 3: Alignment [30 mins]</h2>

<p>In this section we map the reads in our FASTQ files to a reference genome. As
these reads originate from mRNA, we expect some of them will cross exon/intron
boundaries when we align them to the reference genome. Tophat is a splice-aware
mapper for RNA-seq reads that is based on Bowtie. It uses the mapping results
from Bowtie to identify splice junctions between exons. More information on
Tophat can be found <a href="https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/index.shtml">here</a>.</p>

<h4>1.  Map/align the reads with Tophat to the S. cerevisiae reference</h4>

<p>In the left tool panel menu, under NGS Analysis, select
<strong>NGS: RNA Analysis > Tophat</strong> and set the parameters as follows:  </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Is this single-end or paired-end data?</strong> Single-end (as individual datasets)  </li>
<li><p><strong>RNA-Seq FASTQ file, forward reads:</strong> <br />
(Click on the <strong>multiple datasets icon</strong> and select all four of the
FASTQ files)</p>

<ul>
<li><code>batch1_chrI_1.fastq</code></li>
<li><code>batch2_chrI_1.fastq</code></li>
<li><code>chem1_chrI_1.fastq</code></li>
<li><code>chem2_chrI_1.fastq</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Use a built in reference genome or own from your history:</strong> Use
built-in genome</p></li>
<li><strong>Select a reference genome:</strong> S. cerevisiae June 2008 (SGD/SacCer2)
(sacCer2)</li>
<li>Use defaults for the other fields</li>
<li>Execute</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="media/rna_advanced_tophat.png" height=800px></p>

<p>Note: This may take a few minutes, depending on how busy the server is.</p>

<h4>2.  Rename the output files</h4>

<p>You should have 5 output files for each of the FASTQ input files:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Tophat on data 1: accepted_hits:</strong> This is a BAM file containing
sequence alignment data of the reads. This file contains the location
of where the reads mapped to in the reference genome. We will examine
this file more closely in the next step.</li>
<li><strong>Tophat on data 1: splice junctions:</strong> This file lists all the places
where TopHat had to split a read into two pieces to span an exon
junction.</li>
<li><strong>Tophat on data 1 deletions</strong> and <strong>Tophat on data 1: insertions:</strong>
These files list small insertions or deletions found in the reads.
Since we are working with synthetic reads we can ignore Tophat for
Illumina data 1:insertions Tophat for Illumina data 1:deletions for now.</li>
<li><strong>Tophat on data 1: align_summary:</strong> This file gives some mapping
statistics including the number of reads mapped and the mapping rate.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should have a total of 20 Tophat output files in your history.</p>

<p>Rename the 4 accepted_hits files into a more meaningful name (e.g.
'Tophat on data 1: accepted<em>hits' to 'batch1-accepted</em>hits.bam')
by using the <strong>pen icon</strong> next to the file.</p>

<h4>3 [Optional].  Visualise the aligned reads with IGV</h4>

<p>Download the bam files you have created in the previous step by clicking the disk icon on the right-hand panel. Make sure to click both the <strong>Download dataset</strong> and <strong>Download index</strong> buttons. We will now visualise the alignments using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV).</p>

<p><img src="media/download_bam.png" height=800px></p>

<ul>
<li>http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/</li>
<li>Go to <em>Downloads</em></li>
<li>Launch with 1.2Gb</li>
<li><p>Click on igv24_mm.jnlp file that is downloaded</p></li>
<li><p>File -> Load from File</p>

<ul>
<li>select any bam file you aligned with tophat</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Type chrI in the text box in the top of the screen
<ul>
<li>use the <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> buttons to zoom into an area displaying reads</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>[Optional] Convert BAM to SAM</h4>

<p>It useful to understand the BAM/SAM format.  Convert one of your BAM files to SAM format, and
view the text within Galaxy
1.  <strong>NGS: SAM Tools> BAM-to-SAM convert BAM to SAM</strong> and select one of you BAM files
2.  Click on the eye of the resulting file to view the SAM alignments.
3.  Look through the alignments, which chromosome are the aligning to?  Can you see any indels in the CIGAR string?</p>

<hr />

<h2>Section 4. Quantification (Counting reads in features) [30 min]</h2>

<p>HTSeq-count creates a count matrix using the number of the reads from each bam
file that map to the genomic features in the genes.gtf. For each feature (a
gene for example) a count matrix shows how many reads were mapped to this
feature.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use HTSeq-count to count the number of reads for each feature. <br />
In the left tool panel menu, under NGS Analysis, select
<strong>NGS: RNA Analysis > SAM/BAM to count matrix</strong> and set the parameters as follows:  </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Gene model (GFF) file to count reads over from your current history:</strong> genes.gtf</li>
<li><strong>bam/sam file from your history:</strong> <br />
(Select all six bam files using the shift key.)
<ul>
<li><code>batch1-accepted_hits.bam</code></li>
<li><code>batch2-accepted_hits.bam</code></li>
<li><code>chem1-accepted_hits.bam</code></li>
<li><code>chem2-accepted_hits.bam</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use defaults for the other fields</li>
<li>Execute</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Examine the outputted matrix by using the <strong>eye icon</strong>. <br />
Each column corresponds to a sample and each row corresponds to a gene. By
sight, see if you can find a gene you think is differentially expressed
from looking at the counts.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>We now have a count matrix, with a count against each corresponding sample. We
will use this matrix in later sections to calculate the differentially
expressed genes.</p>

<h3>Alternative tool</h3>

<p><strong>If "SAM/BAM to count matrix" is not available on the Galaxy server you are using</strong></p>

<p><strong>NGS Analysis > htseq-count</strong> may be used an alternative</p>

<hr />

<h2>Section 5: edgeR  [30 min]</h2>

<p><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html">edgeR</a>
is an R package, that is used for analysing differential expression of
RNA-Seq data and can either use exact statistical methods or generalised
linear models.</p>

<h4>1.  Generate a list of differentially expressed genes using edgeR</h4>

<p>In the Galaxy tool panel, under NGS Analysis, select
<strong>NGS: RNA Analysis > Differential_Count</strong> and set the parameters as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Select an input matrix - rows are contigs, columns are counts for each
sample:</strong> bams to DGE count matrix_htseqsams2mx.xls</li>
<li><strong>Title for job outputs:</strong> Differential_Counts_edgeR</li>
<li><strong>Treatment Name:</strong> Batch</li>
<li><strong>Select columns containing treatment:</strong> <br />
<ul>
<li><code>batch1-accepted_hits.bam</code></li>
<li><code>batch2-accepted_hits.bam</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Control Name:</strong> Chem</li>
<li><strong>Select columns containing control:</strong> <br />
<ul>
<li><code>chem1-accepted_hits.bam</code></li>
<li><code>chem2-accepted_hits.bam</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Run this model using edgeR:</strong> Run edgeR</li>
<li>Use defaults for the other fields</li>
<li>Execute</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.  Examine the outputs from the previous step</h4>

<ol>
<li>Examine the <code>Differential_Counts_edgeR_topTable_edgeR.xls</code> file by
clicking on the <strong>eye icon</strong>.
This file is a list of genes sorted by p-value from using EdgeR to
perform differential expression analysis.</li>
<li>Examine the <code>Differential_Counts_edgeR.htm</code>l file. This file has some
output logs and plots from running edgeR. If you are familiar with R,
you can examine the R code used for analysis by scrolling to the bottom
of the file, and clicking <code>Differential_Counts.Rscript</code> to download the
Rscript file. <br />
If you are curious about the statistical methods edgeR uses, you can
read the <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html">edgeR user's guide at
Bioconductor</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h4>3.  Extract the significant differentially expressed genes.</h4>

<p>Under Basic Tools, click on <strong>Filter and Sort > Filter</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Filter:</strong> <code>Differential_Counts_edgeR_topTable_edgeR.xls</code></li>
<li><strong>With following condition:</strong> c6 &lt;= 0.05</li>
<li><strong>Number of header lines to skip:</strong> 1</li>
<li>Execute</li>
</ul>

<p>This will keep the genes that have an adjusted p-value (column 6 in the table) of less
or equal to 0.05. There should be 47 genes in this file.
Rename this file by clicking on the <strong>pencil icon</strong> of and change the name
from "Filter on data x" to <code>edgeR_Significant_DE_Genes</code></p>
